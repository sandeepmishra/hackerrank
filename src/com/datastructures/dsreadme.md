#DS
- ###set
    for looking up info inside it.
- ###HashTable
    Helps compilers to find the process running 
- ###Stacks
    Undo operations on all applications, back functionality in browsers
- ###Suffix Tree / Inverted Index
    Used by search engines indexing
- ###Graphs
     Used by social networks.
    
    
  
####Complexity (Time and Space)
    Time and space required for processing. (Complextiy -> waht if input is too long)
     - Big O Notation (worst case)
     - Theta (Average)
     - Omega (Best case)
     
     O(1), O(Log N), O(N), O(N Log N), O(Npow 2) O(2Pow N)
     
     
     for(int i=0;i<n;i++){ // 2 Pow k = N
        i=i*2;
     }

     2Pow K = N
     Log 2pow K = Log N
     K Log 2 = Log N
     k = Log N
     Complexity will be Log(N)
